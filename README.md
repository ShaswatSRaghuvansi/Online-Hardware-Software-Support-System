**Problem Description:** Our system provides 24/7 online access for employees, engineers, department heads, and administrators. It ensures the productivity of your IT staff through fast, accurate, remote technical support for your system environment. Our service covers defect support for various products running on your system hardware. Key factors to consider include downtime costs, skill retention, overheads, customer satisfaction, and more.

In our organization, employees rely on IT-based hardware for their daily tasks. In the event of hardware failure, it's crucial to address and repair these issues promptly. To manage and support these hardware components, we have a dedicated department known as the "SYSTEM ENGINEERS DEPARTMENT." Whenever an issue arises, concerned employees must report it to this department, which, in turn, takes care of the problem.

1. Head of the Department (HOD)
